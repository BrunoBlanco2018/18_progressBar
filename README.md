# BB18 ProgressBar
A simple and clean ProgressBar, it is my first script. I expect that you like it

## How To Use:
You just need to use a export like this:

```lua
    exports['18_progressBar']:ShowUI(3000, "Eating bread")
    -- Time in ms --
```

If you want to use a Wait next to the export you need to use like this:


```lua
    exports['18_progressBar']:ShowUI(3000, "Eating pizza")
    Wait(3000)
    -- Time in ms --
```
